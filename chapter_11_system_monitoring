        $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        129498
        We then can modify the value and verify the change was effected:

        $ sudo bash -c 'echo 100000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max'
        $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        100000

        Viewing and changing the parameters can be done with simple commands. For example, the maximum number of threads allowed on the system can be seen by looking at:

        $ ls -l /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        129498

        We then can modify the value and verify the change was effected:

        $ sudo bash -c 'echo 100000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max'
        $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
        100000

        Remember from our discussion of sysctl the same effect is accomplished by:

        $ sudo sysctl kernel.threads-max=100000

* SAR  stands for the Systems Activity Reporter. It is an all-purpose tool for gathering system activity and performance data and creating reports that are readable by humans
        $ sar [ options ] [ interval ] [ count ]
        
        -OPTIONS SAR
        -A 	Almost all information
        -b 	I/O and transfer rate statistics (similar to iostat)
        -B 	Paging statistics including page faults
        -x 	Block device activity (similar to iostat -x)
        -n 	Network statistics
        -P 	Per CPU statistics (as in sar -P ALL 3)
        -q 	Queue lengths (run queue, processes and threads)
        -r 	Swap and memory utilization statistics
        -R 	Memory statistics
        -u 	CPU utilization (default)
        -v 	Statistics about inodes and files and file handles
        -w 	Context switching statistics
        -W 	Swapping statistics, pages in and out per second
        -f 	Extract information from specified file, created by the -o option
        -o 	Save readings in the file specified, to be read in later with -f option
