*pasos autenticacion
	Several steps are involved in authentication:

    -A user invokes a PAM-aware application, such as login, ssh, or su.
     The application calls libpam.
    
    -The library checks for files in /etc/pam.d; these delineate which PAM modules to invoke, including  system-auth.
    
    -Each referenced module is executed in accordance with the rules of the relevant configuration file  for that application.
