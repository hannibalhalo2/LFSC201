*algunos archivos de configuracion en systemd

    /etc/vconsole.conf: default keyboard mapping and console font.
    /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf: drop-in directory for kernel sysctl parameters.
    /etc/os-release: distribution ID file.

*systemctl

	systemctl is the main utility for managing services. Its basic syntax is:

	$ systemctl [options] command [name]

	-Below you can see some examples of how you can use systemctl:

    	To show the status of everything that systemd controls:
    	$ systemctl
    
    	To show all available services:
    	$ systemctl list-units -t service --all
    
    	To show only active services:
    	$ systemctl list-units -t service
    
    	To start (activate) or stop (deactivate) one or more units:
    	$ sudo systemctl start foo
    	$ statusdo systemctl start foo.service
    	$ sudo systemctl start /path/to/foo.service
    	$ sudo systemctl stop foo.service
    	$ sudo systemctl status service

   		where a unit can be a service or a socket.
    	To enable/disable a service:
    	$ sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
    	$ sudo systemctl disable sshd.service

    	iniciar un servicio al inico del pc
    	systemctl enable nombreservicio

    	que un servicio no inicie al servicio
    	systemctl disable servicio

		S, s     	Same as 1
		0 	Shutdown system and turn power off
		1 	Single User Mode
		2 	Multiple user, no NFS, only text login
		3 	Multiple user, with NFS and network, only text login
		4 	Not used
		5 	Multiple user, with NFS and network, graphical login with X
		6 	Reboot

	-ver en que runlevel esta
	$ runlevel

*chkconfig 
	 is used to query and configure what runlevels the various system services are to run in


    	-Check a particular service to see if it is set up to run in the current runlevel:

    	-This will return true if the service is configured to be running, false otherwise. You should note that even if it is configured to be running, it might currently be stopped.
        See what services are configured to run in each of the runlevels:

    	$ chkconfig some_service

    	-See what services are configured to run in each of the runlevels:	
    	$ chkconfig --list [service names]
    	
    	-Turn on a certain service next time the system boots:
		$ sudo chkconfig some_service on
    
    	-Do not turn a certain service on next time the system boots:
         $ chkconfig some_service off
    
    	You should note that the on and off do not affect the current state by starting or stopping a service. You would have to do that with:
		$ sudo service some_service [stop | start]
