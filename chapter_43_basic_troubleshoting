*pasos para resolucion de problemas 

	
    -Characterize the problem
    -Reproduce the problem
    -Always try the easy things first
    -Eliminate possible causes one at a time
    -Change only one thing at a time; if that doesn't fix the problem, change it back
    -Check the system logs (/var/log/messages, /var/log/secure, etc.) for further information.

*danios en red que revisar

	
    -IP configuration
    	Use ifconfig or ip to see if the interface is up, and if so, if it is configured.
    -Network Driver
    	If the interface can't be brought up, maybe the correct device driver for the network card(s) is not loaded. Check with lsmod if the network driver is loaded as a kernel module, or by examining relevant pseudo-files in /proc and /sys, such as /proc/interrupts or /sys/class/net.
    -Connectivity
    	Use ping to see if the network is visible, checking for response time and packet loss. traceroute can follow packets through the network, while mtr can do this in a continuous fashion. Use of these utilities can tell you if the problem is local or on the Internet.
    -Default gateway and routing configuration
    	Run route -n and see if the routing table makes sense.
    -Hostname resolution
    	Run dig or host on a URL and see if DNS is working properly.

*danios en booteo

	
    -No boot loader screen
    	Check for GRUB misconfiguration, or a corrupt boot sector. You may have to re-install the boot loader.
    
    -Kernel fails to load
    	If the kernel panics during the boot process, it is most likely a misconfigured or corrupt kernel, or incorrect parameters specified on the kernel command line in the GRUB configuration file. If the kernel has booted successfully in the past, it has either been corrupted, or the kernel command line in the GRUB configuration file has been altered in an unproductive way. Depending on which, you can reinstall the kernel, or enter into the interactive GRUB menu at boot and use very minimal command line parameters and try to fix that way. Or, you can try booting into a rescue image as described in the next chapter.
    
    -Kernel loads, but fails to mount the root filesystem
    	The main causes here are:
    	1. Misconfigured GRUB configuration file
    	2. Misconfigured /etc/fstab
    	3. No support for the root filesystem type either built into the kernel or as a module in the initramfs initial ram disk or filesystem.
    
    -Failure during the init process
    	There are many things that can go wrong once init starts; look closely at the messages that are displayed before things stop. If things were working before, with a different kernel, this is a big clue. Look out for corrupted filesystems, errors in startup scripts, etc. Try booting into a lower runlevel, such as 3 (no graphics) or 1 (single user mode). 

*danios o corrupcion en filesystem

	-revise /etc/fstab no este corrupto

	-If the root filesystem has been mounted you can examine this file, but / may have been mounted as read-only, so to edit the file and fix it you can run:

	$ sudo mount -o remount,rw /

	-If /etc/fstab seems to be correct, you can move to fsck. First, you should try:

	$ sudo mount -a

	to try and mount all filesystems. If this does not succeed completely, you can try to manually mount the ones with problems. You should first run fsck to just examine; afterwards, you can run it again to have it try and fix any errors found.
